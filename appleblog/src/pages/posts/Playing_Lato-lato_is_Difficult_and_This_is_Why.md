## abstracts:
Lato-lato, a pendulum-based toy gaining popularity in Indonesian playgrounds, has sparked interest with competitions centered around maintaining its oscillatory motion. While some find it easy to play, the challenge lies in sustaining the oscillation, particularly in maintaining both "up and down collisions." Through a Newtonian dynamics numerical analysis using Python (code by ChatGPT), this study identifies two equilibrium phases - phase 1, characterized by normal pendulum motion, and phase 2, the double collision mode - by using the driven oscillation model. In addition, further analysis and discussion are done using the obtained numeric data. The difficulty in remaining in phase 2 highlights the intricate hand-eye coordination required, shedding light on the toy's appeal and the skill it demands.
