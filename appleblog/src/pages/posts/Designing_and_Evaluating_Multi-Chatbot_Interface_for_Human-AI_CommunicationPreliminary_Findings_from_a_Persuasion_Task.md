## abstracts:
The dynamics of human-AI communication have been reshaped by language models such as ChatGPT. However, extant research has primarily focused on dyadic communication, leaving much to be explored regarding the dynamics of human-AI communication in group settings. The availability of multiple language model chatbots presents a unique opportunity for scholars to better understand the interaction between humans and multiple chatbots. This study examines the impact of multi-chatbot communication in a specific persuasion setting: promoting charitable donations. We developed an online environment that enables multi-chatbot communication and conducted a pilot experiment utilizing two GPT-based chatbots, Save the Children and UNICEF chatbots, to promote charitable donations. In this study, we present our development process of the multi-chatbot interface and present preliminary findings from a pilot experiment. Analysis of qualitative and quantitative feedback are presented, and limitations are addressed.
