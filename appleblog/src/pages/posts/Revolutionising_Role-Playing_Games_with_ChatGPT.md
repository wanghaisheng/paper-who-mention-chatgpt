## abstracts:
Digitalisation in education and its influence on teaching methods is the focus of this study, which examines the use of ChatGPT in a role-playing game used in the Cloud Computing Engineering Master's programme at the University of Applied Sciences Burgenland. The aim of the study was to analyse the impact of AI-based simulations on students' learning experience. Based on Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, ChatGPT was used to give students a deeper understanding of strategic decision-making processes in simulated business scenarios. The methodological approach included role-playing and qualitative content analysis of 20 student reflections. The findings suggest that ChatGPT enhances students' engagement, critical thinking, and communication skills, in addition to contributing to the effective application of theoretical knowledge. Furthermore, simulations can contribute to the effective application of theoretical knowledge. The results underscore the significance of adaptive teaching approaches in promoting digital literacy and equipping learners for the digital workplace. The integration of AI into curricula and the need for ongoing innovation in higher education are also emphasised as a means of guaranteeing excellent, future-focused instruction. The findings highlight the potential of AI and ChatGPT in particular, as an innovative cutting-edge educational tool that can both enhance the learning experience and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through education.
